# GuideDog

## Overview

GuideDog is a AI-powered code library that helps web-developers ensure their code meets web accessibility standards automatically.

GuideDog currently has 3 main commands.

 - npx guidedog init
    Will prompt the user for an OpenAI api key.
    If successful, it will create an assistant with our pregenerated prompt and store crucial information within a config file in the users project directory.


 - npx guidedog check
    Will allow the user to check the current accessibility of their project. The command will provide the user with an accessibility score and a breakdown on key WCAG metrics.

 - npx guidedog write
    Will generate AI-powered accessibility suggestions based of the deficiencies previously detected. Will then prompt the user to check and approve each suggestion


## Notes

This is working on my machine due to my config

- I've got an OPENAI api key which is being read off my machine env vars
- I've run the following git config settings to open properly
  - git config --global diff.tool vscode
  - git config --global difftool.vscode.cmd "code --wait --diff \$LOCAL \$REMOTE"
  - git config --global difftool.prompt false

These will need to be configured in the setup script once we create the node package so that the user doesn't have to mess around with their config for it to work.
